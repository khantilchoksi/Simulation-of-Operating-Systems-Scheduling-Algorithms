# Simulation-of-Operating-Systems-Scheduling-Algorithms

This project gives the users better understanding of different scheduling algorithms graphically.
It is developed in Java and extensively used GUI APIs.

The different scheduling algorithms like First-Come-First-Serve(FCFS), Round Robin scheduling are implemented and by adding other few functionalities one can easily implement other scheduling algorithms.
